# Design a vehicle Parking Lot

# Requirement clarifications:-
    1. Can it have multiple floors?
    2. Will there be multiple entry, exit gates?
    3. Can there be different pricing stratergy / pricing models
    4. Can we assign random parking spot or we have to assign nearest parking spot or this can be dynamic?
    5. Do we need to consider concurrency when multiple entry gates are having arriving cars at the same time?
    6. What are the vehicle types to be parked?
