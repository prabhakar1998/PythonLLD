# Strategy design pattern

1. When there can be different algoritms to do a task, we can use the strategy design pattern. Example for the cab booking system there can be different pricing strategy, differet ride booking strategy algorithms.

This is one of the most common design pattern that is used to build extensible code. As we can build different strategies for the same task.

1. StrategyInterface or StrategyABC can be created with the main functions that will be used by the application

2. Different concrete strategy implementations for the interface or abc.
